/**
 * Platform event -> GENESIS MemoryEvent translation.
 *
 * This is the single definition of how an AKIRA OS event becomes something
 * GENESIS can record. It is pure: no bus, no subscription, no side effect, no
 * I/O. That matters because two callers share it —
 *
 *   - `event-service.ts`, whose legacy-bus subscription has always owned this
 *     logic inline, and
 *   - `reality-adapter.ts`, the instrumentation-bus boundary,
 *
 * and a second copy of these strings is exactly how `note.updated` drifted away
 * from every one of its consumers (see the P1 contract repair).
 *
 * The translator table doubles as the allowlist. Support for an event type and
 * the ability to translate it are the same fact, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * Behaviour is preserved verbatim from the original `switch`, including the
 * places where a malformed payload throws rather than degrading — callers are
 * responsible for isolating that.

 * through any capture surface ever produced a declaration, because the body was
 * not on the event and the description read `Captured thought: "<title>"`.
 *
 * So the body is returned verbatim when there is one. The title is not
 * prepended, deliberately: prefixing anything puts a token in front of the
 * declaration patterns again, and the title is already carried separately as
 * `metadata.title`, which the candidate rules and the validator read.
 *
 * The wrapper survives only as the fallback for a payload with no body -- an
 * event recorded before `content` existed, replayed from the durable stream.
 * Nothing is invented: a payload with neither body nor title still yields the
 * bare "raw thought" text, and the validator holds it.
