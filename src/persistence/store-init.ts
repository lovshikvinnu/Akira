/**
 * Parses a settings blob that the store requires to be an array.
 *
 * `JSON.parse` proves the bytes are JSON; it does not prove the value has the
 * type the store will treat it as. That gap is not cosmetic, because `chat` and
 * `genesis_memories` are persisted by *whole-blob replacement*: `record()`
 * writes `applyDurableRetention([event, ...s.memories])` and `addChatMessage`
 * writes `[...s.chat, msg]`. Spreading a non-array either throws or, for a
 * string, silently spreads its characters -- and the resulting junk array is
 * then written over the real history.
 *
 * Measured against a healthy 7-event stream, one note added after the store had
 * been hydrated with a corrupt value:
 *
 *   {"not":"an array"}   write threw TypeError    disk intact (7)
 *   null                 write threw TypeError    disk intact (7)
 *   "hello"              write completed          disk clobbered  7 -> 6
 *   [{"no":"fields"}]    write completed          disk clobbered  7 -> 2
 *
 * The two that complete are the dangerous ones, and they are dangerous
 * precisely because the loader succeeds: hydration finishes, `__root.tsx`
 * renders `{hydrated ? <Outlet/> : null}`, and the user is working normally
 * while their cognitive history is replaced.
 *
 * Throwing here routes a wrong shape into the failure path malformed bytes
 * already take, which was measured to be safe: the loader throws,
 * `akira.initializeState` never runs, `hydrated` stays false, the UI gate stays
 * shut, and the blob on disk is left untouched for recovery. No new policy is
 * invented and no valid data changes behaviour -- absent still yields `[]` and
 * a well-formed array still passes through unchanged.
 *
 * Deliberately limited to the array-typed blobs. `profile`, `active_session`
 * and `last_project_id` are objects or scalars whose corruption is cosmetic and
 * whose correct fallback is a separate policy question; they are left alone.
